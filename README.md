# Shool
The eventual goal is a Self-Hosting Object-Oriented Language interpreter. Current iteration in Ruby.

As yet unnamed. Might call it 'shoe'. 

## Installation and usage
Clone or download, navigate to project folder, and run `./bin/runner.rb [path to file]`. Currently nonfunctional.

Runs in pure Ruby. Should work with Ruby 2+, but it's only been tested with 2.7+.

## Contributions
Feel free to make pull requests. If any actually show up, I'll be very thankful. I have no idea what I'm doing with testing so update tests if you do.
